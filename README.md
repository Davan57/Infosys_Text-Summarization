## Introduction

Text summarization is the process of reducing a text document in order to create a summary that retains the most important points of the original document. 
This project implements both extractive and abstractive text summarization techniques using various NLP tools and libraries.

## Features

- Extractive summarization using statistical and machine learning methods
- Abstractive summarization using deep learning models
- Preprocessing of text data
- Evaluation metrics for summarization performance
- Integration with popular NLP library like Hugging Face 

## Data Collection

For text summarization, high-quality datasets are essential. In this project, we use the BBC News Summary dataset, which can be easily loaded using the `datasets` library from Hugging Face. The dataset contains news articles and their summaries, making it suitable for training and evaluating summarization models.

## Data Validation

Data validation ensures the quality and consistency of the collected data. Follow these steps:

1. **Consistency Checks:** Verify that each article has a corresponding summary and ensure proper text encoding.
2. **Duplication Removal:** Remove duplicate entries to avoid bias in the training data.
3. **Format Validation:** Check for correct formatting and remove any unwanted characters or tags.
4. **Quality Assessment:** Conduct a manual review of a random sample to check for relevance and coherence.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing prepares raw text data for summarization. Steps include:

1. **Text Cleaning:** Remove special characters, numbers, and irrelevant symbols, and convert text to lowercase.
2. **Tokenization:** Split text into sentences and words using libraries like NLTK or SpaCy.
3. **Stop Word Removal:** Remove common stop words to focus on meaningful words.
4. **Stemming/Lemmatization:** Reduce words to their base or root form.
5. **Padding and Truncation:** Pad sequences to a fixed length or truncate longer texts for model training.
6. **Vectorization:** Convert text to numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or embeddings from Hugging Face Transformers.

## Model Training

Once the data is preprocessed, you can train your summarization models. For extractive summarization, traditional machine learning models like TF-IDF with cosine similarity, or more advanced models like BERT-based extractive summarizers can be used. For abstractive summarization, sequence-to-sequence models like T5 or BART are commonly used. Define training arguments and use appropriate frameworks to train the models.

## Model Validation

After training the model, it's crucial to validate its performance using metrics such as ROUGE scores. ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is commonly used for evaluating the quality of summaries by comparing them to reference summaries. Generate summaries from the validation dataset and compute ROUGE scores to assess model performance.
